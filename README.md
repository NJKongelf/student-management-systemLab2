# Student-Management-System Complex Java lab 2
## **Project creation**

- This Java EE project for the Java 19 course from ITHS was developed by Nicklas Johansson and Luis Gutierrez. We both pair-coded and collaborated to create this laboratorium.

## **Projects obstacles**

- One issue we had during the process of building the rest Endpoints was that we got the "PUT" Method only inserted new data and not 
updated the specific record. The reason behind this was a misunderstanding on how CDI operated with the "@GeneratedValue".
We believed we didn't need to have a method the sets new value. After lots of searching we added the method and like magic the "PUT" method 
started to act as it should.
